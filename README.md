# Hiii, I’m Mariana 🌸🌝

I’m a **Data Science student** with a strong passion for **creativity, art, and technology**.  
I enjoy exploring how data, code, and human-centered thinking can come together to create meaningful and imaginative solutions.

This GitHub is a reflection of my **learning journey**, where curiosity, experimentation, and creativity meet 📊🎨

## 🌱 My Journey

I’m currently completing my **Bachelor’s degree in Data Science at NOVA IMS**.  
Throughout my studies, I’ve worked on projects involving data analysis, machine learning, forecasting, and preprocessing — while also questioning how these technical tools can be used in more **creative and human ways**.

Alongside my technical path, I’ve always been deeply connected to the arts.  
Drawing, painting, sewing, and crafting help shape how I think, problem-solve, and design — and they strongly influence the way I approach technology.

I’m especially interested in paths that **bridge data, art, and interaction**, and I’m actively exploring what that future could look like. I love working on projects that have a **positive impact on the community** and help improve people’s lives through thoughtful and accessible technology. 🌱
